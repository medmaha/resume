          During my studies at Tec Electrical Training Institute, I gained practical experience in a variety of technical areas including PLC systems, photovoltaic, and electrical installation. Through hands-on training and real-world projects, I developed a strong foundation in these fields and gained valuable skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork. Additionally, I had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, ranging from small-scale residential electrical installations to large-scale industrial automation systems, which helped me to develop a broad perspective on the field of electrical and electronics engineering.
